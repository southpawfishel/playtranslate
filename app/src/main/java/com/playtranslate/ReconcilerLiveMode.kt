/**
 * The unified reconciler live loop — ONE sensing pipeline for every live
 * flavor, parameterized by a [LivePresenter] (translation boxes, furigana
 * annotations, panel-only). Grown from the clean-stream TRANSLATION mode and
 * carrying all of its review hardening; see
 * docs/single-app-capture-audit-2026-07-10.md §7 for the design record.
 *
 * Overlay-painting presenters ([LivePresenter.rendersOverlays]) run only
 * on a **clean** MediaProjection stream — the API 34+ "a single app" grant,
 * where the mirror contains only the captured task's surface subtree
 * ([StreamKind.CLEAN], measured by
 * [com.playtranslate.capture.StreamKindProbe]). Our overlay windows, system
 * UI, and every other app are structurally absent from the frames, which
 * dissolves the occlusion problem the pinhole tier exists to fight. A
 * non-painting presenter (panel-only) runs on ANY stream kind and backend —
 * it contaminates nothing, so there is nothing to model.
 *
 * On clean streams specifically:
 *
 *  - Every frame is clean by construction — no cleanRef, no blend model, no
 *    `fillOverlayRegions`, no offscreen overlay renders, no layout-settle
 *    polling, no pixel change gates.
 *  - The game text under a displayed box stays directly visible to OCR, so
 *    "did it change?" is answered in TEXT space by [ScanlineReconciler]:
 *    read the screen, translate the screen, update the screen (Level 0),
 *    plus the sentence-gated typewriter dispatch ([TypewriterGate]).
 *  - Our own repaints never composite into a task mirror, so there is no
 *    self-echo class: no forced follow-up looks, no gate exclusions, no
 *    self-paint epochs.
 *  - Boxes render solid ([CaptureService.showLiveOverlay] `pinholeMode =
 *    false`) — no hole veil; the window alpha cap is a touch-security matter
 *    and unchanged.
 *
 * ## The loop
 * pace → park on the delivery gate (no frame delivered since the last one we
 * consumed ⇒ the screen is unchanged ⇒ free skip) → visibility guard →
 * capture the latched frame → secure-black check → identity guard → full-crop
 * OCR → reconcile → stability hold → apply (kept verbatim; removals now;
 * placeholders for the rest, cached translations instantly, the remainder
 * translated in-cycle). The displayed box list is the only cross-cycle
 * overlay state; the hold map is the only other state of any kind.
 *
 * ## Guards, and why each one is load-bearing
 *  - **Visibility**: when the captured task leaves the foreground the
 *    platform hides the mirrored surface — the stream turns BLACK, not
 *    frozen. A black frame reaching the reconciler would REMOVE every box.
 *    So: hide the overlay window immediately (boxes floating over the
 *    launcher are stale + leak content), keep the box list, park until the
 *    task returns, then force a look — unchanged text re-shows instantly via
 *    KEEP.
 *  - **Identity**: a non-fullscreen task is letterboxed into the frame and
 *    its on-screen offset has NO public API — box placement is impossible,
 *    not just unimplemented. `contentSize != frame size` ⇒ pause with a
 *    message rather than misplace.
 *  - **Secure content**: FLAG_SECURE renders black with no callback — but so
 *    do ordinary loading screens and fades, which games show constantly. So
 *    black frames are handled as content (boxes clear immediately, exactly
 *    as an OCR of a black frame would clear them) while the *message* needs
 *    sustained evidence: only a blackout lasting [SECURE_BLACK_NOTIFY_MS]
 *    earns the "this app blocks capture" error, at most once per session —
 *    a scary permission message on every loading screen costs more trust
 *    than a late explanation costs waiting.
 *  - **Verdict lifetime**: the CLEAN verdict is trusted for the whole
 *    session, with no runtime tripwires — a projection token's scope is
 *    immutable, so a correct verdict cannot become wrong later, and the
 *    probe ([com.playtranslate.capture.StreamKindProbe]) carries the whole
 *    burden of being right. A wrong CLEAN manifests as visible overlay
 *    churn; restarting live mode re-probes. The one mid-session transition
 *    that IS handled: consent teardown RESETS the verdict under a running
 *    mode — the cycle-start guard rebuilds via
 *    [CaptureService.onStreamKindChanged].
