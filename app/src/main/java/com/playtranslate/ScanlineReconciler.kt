/**
 * Text-space single-cycle reconciler — "Level 0". Ported from the `scanlines`
 * branch (built there for swept clean composites); on this branch it drives
 * [ReconcilerLiveMode] — every live flavor's shared sensing loop; overlay
 * presenters run it on API 34+ single-app streams whose frames are clean by
 * construction, the panel presenter on any stream.
 *
 * The mode answers "what changed" in TEXT space, never in pixel space: every
 * cycle it OCRs a clean frame and hands the fresh groups plus the
 * currently-displayed boxes here. This class decides, per region, whether an
 * overlay is still valid, has changed, or has vanished, and which regions to
 * translate — all from a SINGLE read.
 *
 * ## Level 0: read the screen, translate the screen, update the screen
 * There is no confirmation gate, no pending state, no grace counters, and no
 * cross-cycle memory of any kind inside this class — it is a pure function of
 * (groups, boxes) and holds NOTHING between calls. The only cross-cycle memory
 * in the whole mode is the mode's currently-displayed box list, which is handed
 * back in as [boxes]. Every artifact self-heals within one cycle by
 * construction; that is accepted and intended (see the ledger below). (The
 * mode may additionally run a bounded typewriter hold over CHANGED verdicts —
 * see [TypewriterGate] — which is deliberately OUTSIDE this class so the
 * reconciler stays a pure single-read function.)
 *
 * ## Verdicts (see [reconcile])
 *  - **KEEP** — a box pairs with a group whose text is not a significant change
 *    ([OverlayToolkit.isSignificantChange]) and the box already carries a
 *    translation. It passes through verbatim. The dominant steady-state verdict.
 *  - **RETRANSLATE** — a paired box is (re)translated at the group's region.
 *    Two paths lead here: the text differs (the region's content changed, old
 *    box dropped), or the text matches but the box's translation is empty (an
 *    earlier translation failed or returned blank — a plain retry). Either way
 *    the region is emitted in [Verdicts.toTranslate] on THIS read.
 *  - **REMOVE** — a box pairs with no group. It is removed immediately, on the
 *    first empty read. One empty read suffices; there is no grace counter.
 *  - **NEW** — a group pairs with no box. It is translated immediately, on the
 *    first sighting, emitted in [Verdicts.toTranslate].
 *
 * ## Accepted artifact ledger
 * Translating on the first read means transient reads reach the translator:
 *  - A typewriter reveal translates each partial string it is caught mid-frame
 *    ("H", "He", "Hel", …). Each partial self-corrects on the next cycle once
 *    the region's text differs again, and lands on the final translation once
 *    the text stops changing.
 *  - A one-cycle OCR miss (ML Kit hiccup) that drops a region for a single
 *    read removes its box; the box re-appears (re-translated) the moment the
 *    region is read again. The user sees a one-cycle blink.
 *  - A garbage read at a live region translates the garbage once, then
 *    self-heals on the next clean read (text differs → RETRANSLATE).
 * These are the deliberate cost of zero cross-cycle state: the machine can
 * never wedge, stall, or carry stale confirmation — it always reflects the last
 * read, and the last read is at most one cycle old.
 *
 * ## Two deliberate fuzziness layers
 * Neither the region geometry nor the OCR text is ever exact, so both matching
 * layers are intentionally tolerant:
 *  - **Region fuzz** — box↔group pairing is by [LayoutAnalyzer.wouldGroup] in
 *    [LayoutAnalyzer.GroupingMode.CROSS_FRAME_SAME_REGION] mode, NOT by rect
 *    equality. OCR bounds jitter a few pixels every frame (glyph mix,
 *    anti-aliasing); a same-region re-read must still pair with its box or the
 *    whole page would churn REMOVE+NEW on pixel noise.
 *  - **Character fuzz** — a paired box counts as unchanged when
 *    [OverlayToolkit.isSignificantChange] is false: a bag-of-characters
 *    tolerance that absorbs a swapped or dropped glyph or two, so a single OCR
 *    misread does not force a needless retranslation of otherwise-stable text.
 *    The fuzz answers IDENTITY only ("same text, modulo noise") — it must not
 *    also decide WHICH reading is canonical, or a garbled first read within
 *    tolerance would be locked in forever. When a fuzz-same pair's raw strings
 *    differ, [ReadingArbiter] ranks the two readings (confidence, junk score)
 *    and a winning fresh read retranslates as an upgrade
 *    ([Verdicts.upgraded]); ties keep the incumbent, today's behavior.
 * Pairing is by GEOMETRY only — text is judged AFTER pairing, so a same-region
 * re-OCR whose text genuinely changed still pairs (→ RETRANSLATE) instead of
 * falling through to REMOVE + NEW.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin: the only platform type it touches is [android.graphics.Rect]
 * (via [LayoutAnalyzer.wouldGroup] geometry). It injects nothing, holds no
 * state, and is fully deterministic — data in, verdicts out — so it unit-tests
 * on the JVM like [Classification]. Stateless since Level 0, hence an `object`.
 * ONE scoped impurity: an identical-text KEEP ratchets the kept box's stored
 * read score in place ([TextBox.ratchetSourceConf]) — monotone, idempotent,
 * verdict-neutral within the call. It exists because the score is cross-cycle
 * EVIDENCE, and evidence that is stamped once and never refreshed recreates
 * the first-read-wins trap the arbiter was built to remove, one level up.
