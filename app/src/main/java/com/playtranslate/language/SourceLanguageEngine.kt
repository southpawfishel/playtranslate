 *  - [PackMissing]: the expected pack files aren't on disk. Caller should
 *    route the user through the download flow.
 *  - [PackCorrupt]: the pack was present but an **on-disk integrity check**
 *    failed — dict.sqlite can't open, schema check fails, etc. Confirmed
 *    pack-level issue. Caller should uninstall + re-prompt.
 *  - [TokenizerInitFailed]: the pack is on disk, integrity checks passed,
 *    but a tokenizer library threw while warming up. Not necessarily pack
 *    corruption — could be OOM mid-deserialization, transient resource
 *    pressure, or a runtime issue unrelated to file contents. Caller
 *    should NOT auto-delete; log and let the next user interaction retry.
 *
 * The tokenize/lookup methods themselves return empty/null on the same
 * underlying failure modes, so non-preload callers don't need to switch on
 * this — they just see no results. PreloadResult exists so the explicit
 * warm-up path can route pack corruption into user-facing recovery UX
 * without punishing transient init failures with destructive deletion.
