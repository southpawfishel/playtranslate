 *  - [lastServedSeq] is the seq of the frame most recently handed to a *raw*
 *    capture caller — the "what the consumer last saw" cursor. Clean captures
 *    do not advance it: they serve one-shot consumers, and marking their
 *    deliveries as "seen" could hide a change from the live-mode cycle.
 *  - [awaitSeqAfter] suspends until `seqNow() > seq`. Cancellable.
