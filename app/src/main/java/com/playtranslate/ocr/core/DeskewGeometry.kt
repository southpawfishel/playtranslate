/**
 * The shared deskew frame for angle-aware consumers: cluster slanted things by
 * angle, transform their geometry into an axis-aligned frame at the cluster
 * angle, run existing axis-aligned logic there, rotate results back. Used by
 * the grouping shell, LineAssembler banding, and overlay carving — one
 * clusterer, one rounding policy, so their geometry cannot drift apart.
 * No ML Kit / OpenCV imports, same contract as the rest of `ocr.core`.
 *
 * ## Rounding policy (a contract, not an implementation detail)
 * The grouping kernel is integer-Rect and claims byte-determinism, so rotation
 * floats must collapse through ONE rule: dimensions round once, independent of
 * position ([roundHalfUp] of the oriented dims); positions round once, from the
 * center. Always `floor(x + 0.5f)` — never `Math.round` (asymmetric at the
 * negative coordinates an anchor-centered frame produces) and never per-edge
 * rounding (which makes a rect's WIDTH flutter ±1 with sub-pixel position, and
 * width feeds every ratio in the kernel).
 *
 * ## Angles are copied, never computed (program invariant)
 * [AngleCluster.angleDeg] is a verbatim member angle (the longest member's) —
 * no averaging, no trig-derived angles. Trig here CONSUMES angles for placement
 * only. This is what keeps exact `angleDeg != 0f` a safe mode bit everywhere.

     *    capture hazard exists between any two angles (10° mass vs a longer
     *    13.5° banner); 0° merely makes it common.
