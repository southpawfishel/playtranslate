/**
 * Vendor-neutral, pre-layout OCR model.
 *
 * Every engine ([OcrEngine]) maps its native output into these types; the
 * shared [LayoutAnalyzer] then groups [RecognizedRegion]s into the final
 * `OcrResult`. This file has NO ML Kit / MNN / OpenCV imports by design — it is
 * the contract that lets detectors, recognizers, and end-to-end engines compose.
 *
 * ## Coordinate invariant
 * Every [OcrBox] is in **original input-bitmap pixel coordinates** — the space
 * of the [Bitmap] handed to [OcrEngine.recognize]. Each engine adapter undoes
 * its own preprocessing/upscale (ML Kit's scaleFactor divide, Paddle's native
 * mapping) *before* returning, so nothing downstream — grouping, classification,
 * overlay placement — ever sees scaled coordinates.

/**
 * An oriented text box. The axis-aligned [bounds] is the **primary** form (the
 * grouping kernel reads it directly as a field — no per-call compute), and
 * covers the overwhelmingly common upright case. [angleDeg] + [orientedWidth]/
 * [orientedHeight] describe the true (unrotated) rectangle for genuinely slanted
 * text (banners, stamps, SFX), used by overlay rendering and hit-testing.
 *
 * Tategaki is NOT rotation: a vertical column is an axis-aligned tall rectangle
 * with `angleDeg == 0` and [TextOrientation.VERTICAL]. Only [angleDeg] != 0 is a
 * genuine slant, and [isRotated] regions group in deskewed angle-cluster frames
 * ([LayoutAnalyzer.analyze]) — never through the screen-space kernel.
 *
 * Producers route through [OrientedBoxGeometry.boxFor], which snaps |angle| ≤
 * the noise gate ([ANGLE_NOISE_GATE_DEG] by default) to [upright]; [isRotated]
 * is definitionally `angleDeg != 0f`.
