     * are expected to be at the same resolution. Callers should pre-convert
     * view-space rects via [FrameCoordinates.viewToBitmap] before passing in.
     *
     * ## Scale assumption (important)
     *
     * This function is only valid at identity scale (screenshot dims == view
     * dims). [runCycle] fails closed at non-identity scale before reaching
     * here; do not call this at non-identity scale without re-reading the
     * following and reworking the math.
     *
     * The core detection math is:
     *
     *     predicted[i] = (cleanRef[i] + overlayBitmap[i]) / 2
     *     delta[i]     = |raw[i] - predicted[i]|
     *
     * with a pinhole counted as changed when any channel's delta exceeds
     * [PinholeCalibration.SPLATTER_THRESHOLD]. Deliberately RAW deltas, no
     * photometric normalization (2026-07-08 decision): normalizing here
     * trades missed removals (stale overlays — the cardinal failure) for
     * dim-ramp smoothness; a dim now flaps boxes once and self-heals, and
     * the fit lives only on the outside gate where false fires are cheap.
     *
     * This assumes that AT PINHOLE POSITIONS, the raw on-screen pixel is a
     * 50/50 blend of the clean game background (cleanRef) and the solid
     * overlay rendering (overlayBitmap). That's true because:
     *
     *   1. [com.playtranslate.ui.TranslationOverlayView.createPinholeMask]
     *      generates a full-view mask with alpha
     *      [PinholeCalibration.MASK_ALPHA] (50%) at sparse pinhole positions
     *      spaced [PinholeCalibration.PINHOLE_SPACING] apart, 0 elsewhere.
     *      On the MediaProjection backend the window α is reduced to the
     *      system obscuring cap and the mask alpha is compensated so the
     *      *effective* pinhole α is still 50% — the math below is invariant
     *      under that compensation.
     *   2. [com.playtranslate.ui.TranslationOverlayView.dispatchDraw]
     *      composites that mask via DST_OUT on the rendered overlay,
     *      punching 50% holes at the mask positions and leaving non-pinhole
     *      positions fully opaque.
     *   3. The final on-screen pixel at a pinhole is therefore
     *      50% overlay + 50% game.
     *
     * The sampling loop iterates every pixel in the box region and skips
     * non-pinhole positions via [isPinholePosition] using **view-local**
     * coordinates derived from the box's on-screen rect, so the box-local
     * sampling grid lines up with the view's actual on-screen holes.
     *
     * ## Why this breaks at non-identity scale
     *
     * At non-identity scale (e.g. MediaProjection with a scaled virtual
     * display, producing a bitmap smaller than the view):
     *
     *   - The mask's 3-view-pixel spacing no longer corresponds to 3-bitmap-
     *     pixel spacing. Sampling every 3 bitmap pixels hits positions that
     *     aren't actually pinholes.
     *   - More fundamentally: bitmap downsampling averages multiple view
     *     pixels per bitmap pixel. A 2x2 view block contains ~1 pinhole
     *     pixel at 50% alpha and ~3 non-pinhole pixels at 100% alpha,
     *     averaging to ~87% alpha. No bitmap pixel corresponds to a 50%
     *     blend; every bitmap pixel is at ~87% overlay uniformly. The
     *     `predicted = (ref + overlay) / 2` math never matches raw; every
     *     position reports a large delta and the classifier over-flags.
     *
     * Supporting non-identity scale would require, at minimum:
     *   - A pinhole pattern that survives downsampling (e.g. larger mask
     *     elements, not single pixels), OR
     *   - Generating the mask at bitmap resolution and compositing it
     *     directly into `overlayBitmap` so detection has a known-position
     *     pinhole pattern in bitmap space, AND
     *   - Re-tuning [PinholeCalibration.SPLATTER_THRESHOLD] and
     *     [PinholeCalibration.PINHOLE_CHANGE_PCT] for whatever new blend
     *     ratio results.
     *
     * None of this is done today. Identity scale only.
