/**
 * "Headless" card-creation helpers — entry points used when the user
 * long-presses any Add-to-Anki button, so a card lands without
 * passing through the review sheet. They layer **preloading awaits**
 * on top of [Context.sendSentenceCard] / [Context.sendWordCard]:
 * either reuse the data the caller hands them, or await the same
 * [LastSentenceCache] entries the review sheet would have observed.
 *
 * `oneTapSendWord` deliberately takes no sentence context: today's
 * word-card path discards sentence unless the user manually flips to
 * sentence mode inside the sheet, and `AnkiCardOutputBuilder.forWord`
 * hardcodes the SENTENCE / SENTENCE_TRANSLATION fields to "" anyway.
 * One-tap honors that — if the user wants sentence context, they
 * long-press to edit.
 *
 * These helpers do NOT show progress indicators, dismiss UI, or open
 * the mapping dialog — surface UX stays with the call site. Fragment
 * callers go through [launchOneTapSend]; overlay/service callers launch
 * on [ankiOneTapSendScope] directly and degrade their result UX via
 * [oneTapResultToast] when their surface is gone.
 */

/**
 * Process-lived scope for one-tap sends. A long-press send runs detached
 * from the surface that launched it: the card (and its result toast) must
 * land even when that overlay / sheet / fragment is dismissed mid-send —
 * a lifecycle scope would silently cancel the card. One shared scope so
 * no call site re-derives the lifetime decision.

/**
 * Runs [send] on [ankiOneTapSendScope] and presents its result on this
 * fragment — with the send's lifetime and the presentation's lifetime
 * deliberately decoupled, because they have opposite requirements: the
 * card must OUTLIVE the fragment, while the result UI must NOT.
 *
 * Rather than guarding the presentation with lifecycle flags (`isAdded`
 * proves only attachment — not that the view exists, nor that dialogs
 * may be shown; each result arm needs a different check, which is how
 * this went wrong the first time), the safety rules are encoded
 * structurally, so there is nothing to check and nothing to race:
 *
 *  - [presentResult] runs in the VIEW-lifecycle scope, deferred by
 *    [withStarted] until the view is at least STARTED. View death
 *    cancels it before it can touch anything; STARTED implies the
 *    fragment is attached and — on minSdk 29, where onStop precedes
 *    onSaveInstanceState — that FragmentManager commits (the
 *    NeedsMapping dialog) are legal. A send that finishes while the
 *    app is backgrounded simply presents when the user returns.
 *  - If the presentation coroutine is CANCELLED before it ran (view
 *    destroyed mid-send, or while parked in [withStarted]), its
 *    completion cause triggers the degraded path: [oneTapResultToast]
 *    on [appCtx] once the send lands. The cancellation cause is the
 *    handoff signal — exactly one path presents, with no shared flag.
 *
 * [resultOf] and [modeOf] extract the [AnkiSendResult] and the
 * [CardMode] actually sent from [send]'s payload for the degraded
 * toast (identity / a static mode for sentence sends; `first` /
 * `second` for the funnel's result+mode pair).
 *
 * [send] is exception-free by design — the whole pipeline models
 * failures as [AnkiSendResult] values (the cache helpers, audio
 * resolution, and AnkiManager all contain their own throws). A bug
 * that escaped anyway would crash the app from a detached coroutine,
 * disconnected from the gesture and possibly after the UI is gone —
 * so the seam contains it: loud log plus a failure toast, exactly
 * once, through whichever presentation path is live.
