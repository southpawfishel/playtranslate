 * one model per [CardMode], created lazily on first send via
 * [com.playtranslate.AnkiManager.getOrCreatePtModel].
 *
 * Contract with AnkiDroid:
 *  - Models are matched by NAME ONLY. A user may add or reorder fields
 *    in Anki without spawning a duplicate model — [assemble] maps
 *    values by field name onto whatever field list the model actually
 *    has. (This is deliberately unlike the retired v005
 *    `getOrCreateModel`, which required an exact field match.)
 *  - An existing model's templates/CSS are NEVER rewritten — that
 *    would clobber user edits. A template fix ships as a version bump
 *    in the model name (v001 → v002), the same contract as the old
 *    v004 → v005 blob models. Old notes stay on their old model.
