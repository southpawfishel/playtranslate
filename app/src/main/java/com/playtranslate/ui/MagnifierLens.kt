/**
 * Floating magnifier lens shown while the user drags on a JP/ZH/Latin token
 * and persists post-release as the dictionary surface.
 *
 * Visual structure (matches design handoff in
 * /Users/giladgurantz/playtranslate/design_handoff_magnifying_lens):
 *  - A rounded card (16dp radius, BWI_PANEL #15181B, 1dp white-16% border)
 *    holds the zoom / loading / definitions body.
 *  - A coral pill (accent-themed) overhangs the card's top edge by half its
 *    height. It carries the word, a hairline divider, the reading, and a
 *    trailing chevron that signals "tap to drill into Details."
 *  - Two "calm" chip buttons (32dp visible disk, 48dp hit halo) flank the
 *    pill — Speak on the left, Anki on the right. They are no-ops in this
 *    commit; the wiring will land in a follow-up.
 *  - A 10dp triangular arrow drops from the card's bottom edge (or rises
 *    from the top when the lens flips below the finger).
 *
 * Render modes:
 *  - **ZOOM** (drag): zoomed pixels + crosshair fill the card body. The pill
 *    keeps showing the currently-detected token. Chips hidden.
 *  - **LOADING**: spinner + "Looking up…" in the body while OCR/lookup
 *    resolve. Pill shows the word being resolved. Chips hidden.
 *  - **DEFINITIONS** (drag-preview AND sticky): the body shows the
 *    dictionary view (existing rows). Pill shows the looked-up word.
 *    Chips appear only once the lens becomes interactive via
 *    [makeInteractive] — that signals the post-release sticky state where
 *    quick actions are appropriate.
 *
 * Tap routing:
 *  - In sticky mode, tapping anywhere on the card OR the pill fires
 *    [onOpenTap] (opens the detail page). The chevron is purely a visual
 *    cue.
 *  - Chip taps are absorbed (no-op) — they do NOT fall through to the
 *    card-wide open handler.
 *  - The arrow strip and the (currently hidden) pill chrome region outside
 *    the card are non-interactive.
 */

         *   - Loading on: in the re-drag path, [resetToZoom] has just
         *     animated Word→Placeholder toward the wide idle width;
         *     animating again here cancels that tween and redirects to
         *     the narrow spinner-only width so the spinner doesn't sit
         *     in an oversized pill for the OCR duration.
         *
