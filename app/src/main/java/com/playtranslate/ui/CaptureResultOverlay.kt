/**
 * The over-game capture result panel: a bottom-anchored sheet (default 40% of
 * the screen) showing the source section on the left and the target section on
 * the right (stacked when too narrow), drawn over the game without leaving it.
 * The grabber floats in a transparent strip above the sheet's top edge; content
 * buffers above the navigation bar the way a top sheet buffers under the status
 * bar (the fill still reaches the screen edge behind the system bar).
 *
 * Built fresh on [OverlayHost] (the shared window primitive). Mirrors the three
 * load-bearing patterns from [MagnifierLens]: a FIXED full-screen window whose
 * visible child is resized via layout — never the window, which would flash at
 * the gravity anchor — and a transparent full-screen root that catches off-panel
 * taps to dismiss. The drag-handle resize and the swipe/fling-down dismiss are
 * net-new (the lens grows programmatically and has neither).
 *
 * Sections come from the shared [TranslationSectionBinder], so they render and
 * behave exactly like the in-app results page. The words section, Clear, and the
 * Anki pill are intentionally excluded.
