/**
 * The shared recording backend for Text History and LLM context: one
 * session-scoped consumer of the "shown" translation stream (source +
 * translation + rect co-located at every tap seam), gated once by
 * [LogWriteGate], feeding two independent sinks:
 *
 *  - [TranslationHistoryStore] when [Prefs.translationHistoryEnabled] —
 *    durable, user-managed;
 *  - [ContextRing] when [Prefs.llmContextEnabled] — ephemeral pairs read
 *    by [com.playtranslate.translation.llm.LlmPromptTemplates.contextProvider].
 *
 * Passive by design (no thread, no run-gate): the pipeline seams call in.
 * All mutating entry points are MAIN-THREAD ONLY (every seam already runs
 * on Main), which keeps the gate and the row-id map lock-free — and it is
 * also the CLEAR-ORDERING INVARIANT: because every history write launches
 * from Main and the store runs one FIFO dispatcher, a Clear tapped after a
 * commit always lands after that commit's insert; no pre-clear write can
 * resurrect cleared history. A future non-Main caller would break that
 * guarantee and would need a write-generation barrier here;
 * [contextBlockFor] is the one cross-thread read and is safe via the
 * ring's snapshot semantics and live pref reads. Every entry point
 * swallows its own failures — a recorder bug must never reach a capture
 * loop (the LogTraceRecorder contract).
 *
 * Two different lifetimes, on purpose — don't "unify" them:
 *  - [sessionId] is a row-grouping LABEL, re-minted at construction, on
 *    [onLiveStarted], and on a language-pair change.
 *  - DEDUPE lifetime (gate seen/near-dup/region-mute state, tracked rows)
 *    is the recorder's lifetime within one language pair. Live stop/start
 *    deliberately does NOT reset it: a restart in the same scene re-OCRs
 *    the whole visible screen, and a reset would re-log every line as
 *    fresh and force muted UI regions to re-earn their mutes after every
 *    toggle. Dedupe resets ONLY on a pair change or an explicit history
 *    clear/delete. (Long-range dedupe is a deliberate improvement over
 *    LunaTranslator's consecutive-only and GSM's 2-second window.)
 * [onLiveStopped] clears the ring — the DB persists across sessions,
 * LLM context never does.
