## Features

- **One-tap Translation**: Capture the game screen and translate Japanese text with one tap
- **Auto Translation Mode**: Automatically translates as dialogue changes, no tapping required
- **Word lookup**: Hover the floating lens over any word for immediate dictionary definitionss
- **Offline**: OCR and dictionary lookups work without an internet connection, with optional offline translation models
- **Furigana/Pinyin Mode**: Show reading hints above characters in real time
- **Hotkeys**: Configure a physical key to hold-to-preview translations or furigana, great for handhelds with dedicated buttons
- **Dual Screen & Split Screen**: Works across both screens on dual-display devices like the Ayn Thor, or in Android split-screen alongside windowed games
- **Capture regions**: Crop to just the dialogue box, subtitles, or any custom area
- **Text-to-speech**: Hear text spoken aloud. Change the default voice in settings
- **Anki export**: Save sentences to AnkiDroid with the original text, translation, word list, target words, text-to-speech, and a screenshot. Even record and include game audio! Card type selection with presets for popular decks.
- **Yomitan integration**: Yomitan dictionaries seamlessly integrate, including pitch accent, frequency chips, kanji enrichment, and merged term definitions everywhere (incl. Anki). Look for deeper integration in the future
- **Camera translation**: point your camera at text in the world and read it live, or freeze a frame to tap words and look them up.
- **Text History**: keep a record of captured sentences. Off by default.

## How to Use

1. [Download the latest release by clicking here](../../releases/download/v3.1.0/PlayTranslate-3.1.0.apk)
2. On your Android, enable **Settings → Security → Install unknown apps** for your file manager or browser
3. Open the APK and tap Install
4. On first launch, follow the onboarding steps to grant the necessary permissions

### Won't install?

On some Android devices, **Google Play Protect** blocks sideloaded APKs and shows a vague "App not installed" or "harmful app" warning. If that happens, temporarily disable the scanner:

1. Open the **Play Store**
2. Tap your **profile icon** (top right)
3. Tap **Play Protect**
4. Tap the **gear icon** (top right)
5. Turn off **Scan apps with Play Protect**

Install the APK, then re-enable Play Protect afterward to keep scanning your other apps.

### Can't enable accessibility?

A few advanced features (like hotkey hold-to-preview) will prompt you to enable accessibility permissions. Some Android OEMs block sideloaded apps from receiving accessibility permissions by default, and the toggle in Settings might be grayed out or show a "Restricted setting" message. To unblock it:

1. Open **Settings → Apps → PlayTranslate**
2. Tap the **⋮** menu (top right)
3. Tap **Allow restricted settings**
4. Authenticate when prompted

You can now turn on accessibility for PlayTranslate.

## Optional: Online Translation Backends

By default, translation uses [Lingva](https://github.com/thedaviddelta/lingva-translate) with ML Kit as an offline fallback. For higher quality translations, you can plug in an API key for any of the following under **Settings → Translation services**. Add as many as you like — each service is its own entry in the list, so you can keep several configured and reorder them to pick which one translates first:

- **DeepL**: free tier at [deepl.com/en/pro#developer](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro#developer)
- **OpenAI**: [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) — pick a model at runtime
- **Gemini**: [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) — pick a model at runtime
- **DeepSeek**: [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) — pick a model at runtime
- **Mistral**: [console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys) — pick a model at runtime
- **Groq**: [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/keys) — pick a model at runtime
- **OpenRouter**: [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/keys) — pick a model at runtime
- **Custom**: any other OpenAI-compatible endpoint — point it at your own base URL

## Optional: Anki Flashcards

Install [AnkiDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki) and grant PlayTranslate access in Settings to export cards directly to your decks.

### Adapted from other projects

Work we reimplemented rather than linked. No source was copied verbatim.

- [offline-translator](https://github.com/DavidVentura/offline-translator) (David Ventura): its `translator-rs` planar tracking engine is the design reference for the camera tool's keyframe-OCR tracker. We took the split between optical flow that sustains correspondences and descriptor re-matching that corrects drift, the Idle/Locked/Lost lifecycle with inlier hysteresis, the anchor cache that re-locks a previously seen scene without re-running OCR, and several tuned thresholds. Independently reimplemented in Kotlin over OpenCV, without the reference's IMU prior and with a smoothing filter of our own (offline-translator GPL 3.0; `translator-rs` MIT)
- [PyThaiNLP](https://github.com/PyThaiNLP/pythainlp): Thai word segmentation, a faithful Kotlin port of its `newmm` maximal-matcher, run over a word list that includes its CC0 list (Apache 2.0)
- [docTR](https://github.com/mindee/doctr) and [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR): line-grouping logic adapted for OCR word-box assembly, following docTR's recognize-then-group architecture with thresholds modelled on docTR `_resolve_lines` and EasyOCR `group_text_box` (Apache 2.0)
- [Yomitan](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan): the dictionary format our importer and styled renderer target — structured-content glossaries, per-dictionary CSS scoping, and media references. `YomitanContentHtml` is an independent Kotlin implementation of the format's tag and inline-style whitelists, following Yomitan's render-side sanitisation model (GPL 3.0)
